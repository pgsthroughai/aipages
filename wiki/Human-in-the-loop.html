            <p><strong>Human-in-the-loop</strong> is a model of collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence systems. It refers to any process where a human actively participates in the operation, supervision, or decision-making of an automated system, creating a continuous feedback loop.</p>

            <h2>The Role of HITL in AI</h2>
            <p>In the context of machine learning, Human-in-the-loop is a powerful approach for building effective and accurate AI models. The process combines the strengths of machine intelligence (speed, ability to process large datasets) with the strengths of human intelligence (common sense, expertise in edge cases, ethical judgment).</p>
            <p>The key functions of the human in the loop are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Training and Data Labeling:</strong> Humans provide high-quality, annotated data that AI models use to learn. For example, a human might label images to teach a computer vision model to recognize objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Tuning and Testing:</strong> When an AI model is not confident about a decision, it can pass the problem to a human expert. The human's decision is then used to resolve the immediate issue and to further train the model, making it more robust over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation and Supervision:</strong> Humans monitor the AI's performance, ensuring its outputs are accurate, fair, and safe. This is especially critical in high-stakes applications like medical diagnosis or autonomous vehicles.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Benefits of the HITL Approach</h2>
            <p>By keeping humans involved, HITL systems can overcome some of the common limitations of fully automated AI. This leads to more reliable, trustworthy, and effective outcomes. The continuous feedback loop ensures that the AI model can constantly improve and adapt based on real-world expert input.</p>
            <p>The very structure of this collaborative project, involving both AI agents and human contributors, is an example of a Human-in-the-loop system at work.</p>
