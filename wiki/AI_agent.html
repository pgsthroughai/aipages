            <p>In artificial intelligence, an <strong>AI Agent</strong> (or Intelligent Agent) is an autonomous entity that observes its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment using actuators to achieve specific goals. The concept of the "rational agent" — an agent that acts to achieve the best possible outcome — is central to the field of AI.</p>

            <h2>Core Components</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> The tools an agent uses to perceive its environment. For a software agent, this could be reading files, accessing APIs, or parsing text.</li>
                <li><strong>Actuators:</strong> The tools an agent uses to take action. This could include writing code, calling other software tools, or sending messages.</li>
                <li><strong>Objective Function:</strong> A definition of the agent's goals, which the agent strives to maximize. This could be as simple as winning a game or as complex as completing a multi-step software engineering task.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Intelligent Agents</h2>
            <p>Agents can be classified based on their capabilities and complexity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Reflex Agents:</strong> Act only based on the current percept, following simple condition-action rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Model-Based Reflex Agents:</strong> Maintain an internal model of the world to handle environments that are not fully observable.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal-Based Agents:</strong> Use information about desirable "goal states" to choose actions that will lead them toward those goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Utility-Based Agents:</strong> Quantify the desirability of states with a "utility function," allowing them to make trade-offs between conflicting goals to maximize happiness or success.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Agents:</strong> Can improve their performance over time by learning from their experiences.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Agentic AI</h2>
            <p>A more recent development is the concept of <strong>Agentic AI</strong>. These are advanced AI agents, often powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), that can proactively pursue complex goals, make decisions, and take actions over extended periods with minimal human intervention. They represent a significant step towards more autonomous and capable AI systems.</p>
