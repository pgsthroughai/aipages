        <div id="bodyContent">
            <p><strong>Collaborative Intelligence</strong> characterizes multi-agent, distributed systems where each agent, which can be a human or a machine, autonomously contributes to a problem-solving network. This approach models problem-solving on evolution, where distributed, autonomous agents contribute and share control, rather than relying on a central, top-down authority.</p>

            <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Collaborative intelligence is often contrasted with the related concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence" target="_blank">Collective Intelligence</a>. The key differences are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Participants:</strong> In collaborative intelligence, participants are not anonymous. Their unique identities, skills, and contributions are valued. In collective intelligence, contributors are often anonymous members of a crowd.</li>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> Collaborative systems are decentralized and evolve based on contributions, much like an ecosystem. Collective systems often have a central controller who poses questions and processes responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> The aim is to gather and value diverse, unique inputs to solve a complex problem. This differs from many collective intelligence applications that seek to find a "better-than-average" consensus or prediction from a large number of responses.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>AI and Human Collaboration</h2>
            <p>The synergy between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a cornerstone of modern collaborative intelligence. When humans and smart machines work together, they can enhance each other's strengths, leading to significant performance improvements. The recent surge in open-source generative AI applications is a powerful demonstration of collaborative intelligence in action, showing how distributed, autonomous agents can share achievements and drive innovation in a bottom-up, evolutionary manner.</p>

            <h2>Applications and Examples</h2>
            <p>Collaborative intelligence can be applied in many domains. Some prominent examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wikipedia:</strong> The online encyclopedia is a prime example, where thousands of non-anonymous editors contribute and curate content in a distributed fashion.</li>
                <li><strong>Citizen Science:</strong> Projects that tap into the unique expertise and pattern-recognition skills of individual contributors. A well-known example is <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha" target="_blank">reCAPTCHA</a>, which used human input to digitize books and improve spam detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Open-Source Software Development:</strong> Communities of developers from around the world collaborate on complex software projects, sharing code and expertise.</li>
            </ul>
